# TensorFlow-Based Text-Classification with Raw Text using the Embedding Space

## Introduction
Artificial intelligence is growing very fast and changing the way we live and work. One of the powerful areas of AI is Natural Language Processing (NLP). This in simple terms, is a way in which computers process and understand human language such as text or speech by breaking down the words or sentences into smaller parts and converting the texts into numerical representations called vectors. This NLP research work focuses on using multi-class text classification models to categorize customer inquiries or support requests in the commercial banking system based on their intent/context and using the category label to automatically route the ticket to the appropriate team or department that handles such inquiries or issues. These issues could be related to various banking services such as equity and advisory, providing credit and debit cards, overdraft services, transaction processing, foreign exchange, etc. The research work uses three embedding space namely Neural Network Language Model with 128 dimensions and normalization(NNLM-128-with-normalization), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers), and then the Neural Network Language Model with 50 dimensions and normalization (NNLM-50-with-normalization).
This idea can improve efficiency by analyzing the text in incoming service requests leveraging powerful text classification techniques and categorizing and prioritizing support requests based on their content and urgency.
